# JLNRMenuController

TODO: This project is still in flux, do not use.

## Requirements

`JLNRMenuController` has been tested on iOS 7 and 8. It should be easy get it to work on iOS 6 as well. `JLNRMenuController` uses `UICollectionView` internally, so using it on iOS 5 could possibly work if you use it with [PSTCollectionView](https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView).

## Installation

You can simply copy the files in `Classes` into your project, but the easiest way is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like JLNRGravityImageView in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/wiki/Getting-Started-with-AFNetworking).

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
